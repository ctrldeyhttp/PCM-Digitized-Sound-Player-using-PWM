# PCM-Digitized-Sound-Player-using-PWM
I developed an 8086 assembly language program tailored for the DOSBox emulator, specifically designed to play PCM digitized audio. The core functionality of this program revolves around employing the pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique to handle audio playback, which is particularly effective for generating audio signals with limited hardware resources. 

To demonstrate the capabilities of this program, I utilized a digitized version of the "Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) official hymn" as the audio sample. This hymn was processed and played back at a sampling rate of 8 kHz to ensure compatibility and performance efficiency within the DOSBox environment. The 8 kHz rate was chosen as a balance between audio quality and the processing capability of the emulator, providing a clear and accurate representation of the hymn while maintaining a manageable data throughput rate.

The choice of the PLM hymn highlights the programâ€™s utility in educational and institutional settings, where such hymns and anthems are often used. The implementation showcases how assembly language can be used to directly manipulate hardware-level operations for audio processing, making it a valuable educational tool for understanding both software and hardware aspects of computing in a historical context.
